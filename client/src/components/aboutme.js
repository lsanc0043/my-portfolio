      <h1>All About Linda</h1>
      <p>
        My name is Linda Sanchez. I was born and raised in Los Angeles, CA. My
        first language is Cantonese, but over the years I have also learned
        Mandarin, Korean, and English (yes, this is still a work in progress).{" "}
        <strong>This is my first website!</strong> I had a lot of fun building
        it and hope to look back on it one day and compare it to the more
        advanced projects I will make in the future.
